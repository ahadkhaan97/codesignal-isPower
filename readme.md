Determine if the given number is a power of some non-negative integer.

Example

For n = 125, the output should be
solution(n) = true;
For n = 72, the output should be
solution(n) = false.
Input/Output

[execution time limit] 3 seconds (kt)

[input] integer n

A positive integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 400.

[output] boolean

true if n can be represented in the form ab (a to the power of b) where a and b are some non-negative integers and b ≥ 2, false otherwise.
